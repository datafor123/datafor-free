 * This class was created to solve the following jira case.
 * 
 * PDB-1122 Space in the filter name causes an XPATH error in charting. http://jira.pentaho.com/browse/PDB-1122
 * 
 * When creating charts on Dashboards with parameters using blank spaces the ActionSequence DOM generation was failing
 * due to those parameters with blank spaces getting used to create xml elements.
 * 
 * Look for references to this class to see where those blank spaces are encoded/decoded to solve this issue.
