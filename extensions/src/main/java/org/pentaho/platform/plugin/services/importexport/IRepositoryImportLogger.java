/**
 * * Below is a sample of how to use this class to generate a log file. 1) You must use startJob(OutputStream,
 * ImportPath) to instantiate the log and supply it with an output stream to hold the log and the root folder of the
 * import.
 * 
 * 2) Call setCurrentFilePath() each time you start processing a new import file. The log shows the file being imported
 * so it must be registered.
 * 
 * 3) Call endJob() when the import is done to log the finish and release resources. If the the import terminates
 * abnormally this call should be in the finally block.
 * 
 * 
 * Sample code taken from RepositoryImportLogTest
 * 
 * FileOutputStream fileStream = new FileOutputStream(outputFile); logger =
 * PentahoSystem.get(IRepositoryImportLogger.class);
 * 
 * //You must call this method to start posting the log. logger.startJob(fileStream, "/import/Path");
 * 
 * logger.setCurrentFilePath("/path/file1path"); logger.debug("Some more detail here"); logger.info("Success");
 * 
 * logger.setCurrentFilePath("path/file2path");
 * 
 * //Simulate an exception try { throw new RuntimeException("forced exception"); } catch (Exception e) {
 * logger.error(e); } //End of job logger.endJob();
