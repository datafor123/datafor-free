 * to use this class would be to use it along with <code>UnionizingLdapSearch</code> to return a list of additional
 * roles or usernames. This is useful when you want to use the Admin Permissions interface to assign ACLs but the role
 * or username that you wish to use is not actually present in the directory (e.g. <code>Anonymous</code>).
