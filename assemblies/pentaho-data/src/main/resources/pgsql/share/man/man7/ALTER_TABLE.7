.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBALTER TABLE\fR
changes the definition of an existing table\&. There are several subforms described below\&. Note that the lock level required may differ for each subform\&. An
ACCESS EXCLUSIVE
lock is acquired unless explicitly noted\&. When multiple subcommands are given, the lock acquired will be the strictest one required by any subcommand\&.
.PP
ADD COLUMN [ IF NOT EXISTS ]
.RS 4
This form adds a new column to the table, using the same syntax as
CREATE TABLE (\fBCREATE_TABLE\fR(7))\&. If
IF NOT EXISTS
is specified and a column already exists with this name, no error is thrown\&.
.RE
.PP
DROP COLUMN [ IF EXISTS ]
.RS 4
This form drops a column from a table\&. Indexes and table constraints involving the column will be automatically dropped as well\&. Multivariate statistics referencing the dropped column will also be removed if the removal of the column would cause the statistics to contain data for only a single column\&. You will need to say
CASCADE
if anything outside the table depends on the column, for example, foreign key references or views\&. If
IF EXISTS
is specified and the column does not exist, no error is thrown\&. In this case a notice is issued instead\&.
.RE
.PP
SET DATA TYPE
.RS 4
This form changes the type of a column of a table\&. Indexes and simple table constraints involving the column will be automatically converted to use the new column type by reparsing the originally supplied expression\&. The optional
COLLATE
clause specifies a collation for the new column; if omitted, the collation is the default for the new column type\&. The optional
USING
clause specifies how to compute the new column value from the old; if omitted, the default conversion is the same as an assignment cast from old data type to new\&. A
USING
clause must be provided if there is no implicit or assignment cast from old to new type\&.
.RE
.PP
SET/DROP DEFAULT
.RS 4
These forms set or remove the default value for a column\&. Default values only apply in subsequent
\fBINSERT\fR
or
\fBUPDATE\fR
commands; they do not cause rows already in the table to change\&.
.RE
.PP
SET/DROP NOT NULL
.RS 4
These forms change whether a column is marked to allow null values or to reject null values\&. You can only use
SET NOT NULL
when the column contains no null values\&.
.sp
If this table is a partition, one cannot perform
DROP NOT NULL
on a column if it is marked
NOT NULL
in the parent table\&. To drop the
NOT NULL
constraint from all the partitions, perform
DROP NOT NULL
on the parent table\&. Even if there is no
NOT NULL
constraint on the parent, such a constraint can still be added to individual partitions, if desired; that is, the children can disallow nulls even if the parent allows them, but not the other way around\&.
.RE
.PP
ADD GENERATED { ALWAYS | BY DEFAULT } AS IDENTITY
.br
SET GENERATED { ALWAYS | BY DEFAULT }
.br
DROP IDENTITY [ IF EXISTS ]
.RS 4
These forms change whether a column is an identity column or change the generation attribute of an existing identity column\&. See
CREATE TABLE (\fBCREATE_TABLE\fR(7))
for details\&.
.sp
If
DROP IDENTITY IF EXISTS
is specified and the column is not an identity column, no error is thrown\&. In this case a notice is issued instead\&.
.RE
.PP
SET \fIsequence_option\fR
.br
RESTART
.RS 4
These forms alter the sequence that underlies an existing identity column\&.
\fIsequence_option\fR
is an option supported by
ALTER SEQUENCE (\fBALTER_SEQUENCE\fR(7))
such as
INCREMENT BY\&.
.RE
.PP
SET STATISTICS
.RS 4
This form sets the per\-column statistics\-gathering target for subsequent
\fBANALYZE\fR(7)
operations\&. The target can be set in the range 0 to 10000; alternatively, set it to \-1 to revert to using the system default statistics target (default_statistics_target)\&. For more information on the use of statistics by the
PostgreSQL
query planner, refer to
Section\ \&14.2\&.
.sp
SET STATISTICS
acquires a
SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
lock\&.
.RE
.PP
SET ( \fIattribute_option\fR = \fIvalue\fR [, \&.\&.\&. ] )
.br
RESET ( \fIattribute_option\fR [, \&.\&.\&. ] )
.RS 4
This form sets or resets per\-attribute options\&. Currently, the only defined per\-attribute options are
n_distinct
and
n_distinct_inherited, which override the number\-of\-distinct\-values estimates made by subsequent
\fBANALYZE\fR(7)
operations\&.
n_distinct
affects the statistics for the table itself, while
n_distinct_inherited
affects the statistics gathered for the table plus its inheritance children\&. When set to a positive value,
\fBANALYZE\fR
will assume that the column contains exactly the specified number of distinct nonnull values\&. When set to a negative value, which must be greater than or equal to \-1,
\fBANALYZE\fR
will assume that the number of distinct nonnull values in the column is linear in the size of the table; the exact count is to be computed by multiplying the estimated table size by the absolute value of the given number\&. For example, a value of \-1 implies that all values in the column are distinct, while a value of \-0\&.5 implies that each value appears twice on the average\&. This can be useful when the size of the table changes over time, since the multiplication by the number of rows in the table is not performed until query planning time\&. Specify a value of 0 to revert to estimating the number of distinct values normally\&. For more information on the use of statistics by the
PostgreSQL
query planner, refer to
Section\ \&14.2\&.
.sp
Changing per\-attribute options acquires a
SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
lock\&.
.RE
.PP
SET STORAGE
.RS 4
This form sets the storage mode for a column\&. This controls whether this column is held inline or in a secondary
TOAST
table, and whether the data should be compressed or not\&.
PLAIN
must be used for fixed\-length values such as
integer
and is inline, uncompressed\&.
MAIN
is for inline, compressible data\&.
EXTERNAL
is for external, uncompressed data, and
EXTENDED
is for external, compressed data\&.
EXTENDED
is the default for most data types that support non\-PLAIN
storage\&. Use of
EXTERNAL
will make substring operations on very large
text
and
bytea
values run faster, at the penalty of increased storage space\&. Note that
SET STORAGE
doesn\*(Aqt itself change anything in the table, it just sets the strategy to be pursued during future table updates\&. See
Section\ \&67.2
for more information\&.
.RE
.PP
ADD \fItable_constraint\fR [ NOT VALID ]
.RS 4
This form adds a new constraint to a table using the same constraint syntax as
CREATE TABLE (\fBCREATE_TABLE\fR(7)), plus the option
NOT VALID, which is currently only allowed for foreign key and CHECK constraints\&.
.sp
Normally, this form will cause a scan of the table to verify that all existing rows in the table satisfy the new constraint\&. But if the
NOT VALID
option is used, this potentially\-lengthy scan is skipped\&. The constraint will still be enforced against subsequent inserts or updates (that is, they\*(Aqll fail unless there is a matching row in the referenced table, in the case of foreign keys, or they\*(Aqll fail unless the new row matches the specified check condition)\&. But the database will not assume that the constraint holds for all rows in the table, until it is validated by using the
VALIDATE CONSTRAINT
option\&. See
NOTES
below for more information about using the
NOT VALID
option\&.
.sp
Although most forms of
ADD \fItable_constraint\fR
require an
ACCESS EXCLUSIVE
lock,
ADD FOREIGN KEY
requires only a
SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE
lock\&. Note that
ADD FOREIGN KEY
also acquires a
SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE
lock on the referenced table, in addition to the lock on the table on which the constraint is declared\&.
.RE
.PP
ADD \fItable_constraint_using_index\fR
.RS 4
This form adds a new
PRIMARY KEY
or
UNIQUE
constraint to a table based on an existing unique index\&. All the columns of the index will be included in the constraint\&.
.sp
The index cannot have expression columns nor be a partial index\&. Also, it must be a b\-tree index with default sort ordering\&. These restrictions ensure that the index is equivalent to one that would be built by a regular
ADD PRIMARY KEY
or
ADD UNIQUE
command\&.
.sp
If
PRIMARY KEY
is specified, and the index\*(Aqs columns are not already marked
NOT NULL, then this command will attempt to do
ALTER COLUMN SET NOT NULL
against each such column\&. That requires a full table scan to verify the column(s) contain no nulls\&. In all other cases, this is a fast operation\&.
.sp
If a constraint name is provided then the index will be renamed to match the constraint name\&. Otherwise the constraint will be named the same as the index\&.
.sp
After this command is executed, the index is
\(lqowned\(rq
by the constraint, in the same way as if the index had been built by a regular
ADD PRIMARY KEY
or
ADD UNIQUE
command\&. In particular, dropping the constraint will make the index disappear too\&.

Adding a constraint using an existing index can be helpful in situations where a new constraint needs to be added without blocking table updates for a long time\&. To do that, create the index using
\fBCREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY\fR, and then install it as an official constraint using this syntax\&. See the example below\&.

.RE
.RE
.PP
ALTER CONSTRAINT
.RS 4
This form alters the attributes of a constraint that was previously created\&. Currently only foreign key constraints may be altered\&.
.RE
.PP
VALIDATE CONSTRAINT
.RS 4
This form validates a foreign key or check constraint that was previously created as
NOT VALID, by scanning the table to ensure there are no rows for which the constraint is not satisfied\&. Nothing happens if the constraint is already marked valid\&. (See
NOTES
below for an explanation of the usefulness of this command\&.)
.sp
This command acquires a
SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
lock\&.
.RE
.PP
DROP CONSTRAINT [ IF EXISTS ]
.RS 4
This form drops the specified constraint on a table\&. If
IF EXISTS
is specified and the constraint does not exist, no error is thrown\&. In this case a notice is issued instead\&.
.RE
.PP
DISABLE/ENABLE [ REPLICA | ALWAYS ] TRIGGER
.RS 4
These forms configure the firing of trigger(s) belonging to the table\&. A disabled trigger is still known to the system, but is not executed when its triggering event occurs\&. For a deferred trigger, the enable status is checked when the event occurs, not when the trigger function is actually executed\&. One can disable or enable a single trigger specified by name, or all triggers on the table, or only user triggers (this option excludes internally generated constraint triggers such as those that are used to implement foreign key constraints or deferrable uniqueness and exclusion constraints)\&. Disabling or enabling internally generated constraint triggers requires superuser privileges; it should be done with caution since of course the integrity of the constraint cannot be guaranteed if the triggers are not executed\&. The trigger firing mechanism is also affected by the configuration variable
session_replication_role\&. Simply enabled triggers will fire when the replication role is
\(lqorigin\(rq
(the default) or
\(lqlocal\(rq\&. Triggers configured as
ENABLE REPLICA
will only fire if the session is in
\(lqreplica\(rq
mode, and triggers configured as
ENABLE ALWAYS
will fire regardless of the current replication mode\&.
.sp
This command acquires a
SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE
lock\&.
.RE
.PP
DISABLE/ENABLE [ REPLICA | ALWAYS ] RULE
.RS 4
These forms configure the firing of rewrite rules belonging to the table\&. A disabled rule is still known to the system, but is not applied during query rewriting\&. The semantics are as for disabled/enabled triggers\&. This configuration is ignored for
ON SELECT
rules, which are always applied in order to keep views working even if the current session is in a non\-default replication role\&.
.RE
.PP
DISABLE/ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY
.RS 4
These forms control the application of row security policies belonging to the table\&. If enabled and no policies exist for the table, then a default\-deny policy is applied\&. Note that policies can exist for a table even if row level security is disabled \- in this case, the policies will NOT be applied and the policies will be ignored\&. See also
CREATE POLICY (\fBCREATE_POLICY\fR(7))\&.
.RE
.PP
NO FORCE/FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY
.RS 4
These forms control the application of row security policies belonging to the table when the user is the table owner\&. If enabled, row level security policies will be applied when the user is the table owner\&. If disabled (the default) then row level security will not be applied when the user is the table owner\&. See also
CREATE POLICY (\fBCREATE_POLICY\fR(7))\&.
.RE
.PP
CLUSTER ON
.RS 4
This form selects the default index for future
\fBCLUSTER\fR(7)
operations\&. It does not actually re\-cluster the table\&.
.sp
Changing cluster options acquires a
SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
lock\&.
.RE
.PP
SET WITHOUT CLUSTER
.RS 4
This form removes the most recently used
\fBCLUSTER\fR(7)
index specification from the table\&. This affects future cluster operations that don\*(Aqt specify an index\&.
.sp
Changing cluster options acquires a
SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
lock\&.
.RE
.PP
SET WITH OIDS
.RS 4
This form adds an
oid
system column to the table (see
Section\ \&5.4)\&. It does nothing if the table already has OIDs\&.
.sp
Note that this is not equivalent to
ADD COLUMN oid oid; that would add a normal column that happened to be named
oid, not a system column\&.
.RE
.PP
SET WITHOUT OIDS
.RS 4
This form removes the
oid
system column from the table\&. This is exactly equivalent to
DROP COLUMN oid RESTRICT, except that it will not complain if there is already no
oid
column\&.
.RE
.PP
SET TABLESPACE
.RS 4
This form changes the table\*(Aqs tablespace to the specified tablespace and moves the data file(s) associated with the table to the new tablespace\&. Indexes on the table, if any, are not moved; but they can be moved separately with additional
SET TABLESPACE
commands\&. All tables in the current database in a tablespace can be moved by using the
ALL IN TABLESPACE
form, which will lock all tables to be moved first and then move each one\&. This form also supports
OWNED BY, which will only move tables owned by the roles specified\&. If the
NOWAIT
option is specified then the command will fail if it is unable to acquire all of the locks required immediately\&. Note that system catalogs are not moved by this command, use
\fBALTER DATABASE\fR
or explicit
\fBALTER TABLE\fR
invocations instead if desired\&. The
information_schema
relations are not considered part of the system catalogs and will be moved\&. See also
CREATE TABLESPACE (\fBCREATE_TABLESPACE\fR(7))\&.
.RE
.PP
SET { LOGGED | UNLOGGED }

UNLOGGED)\&. It cannot be applied to a temporary table\&.
.RE
.PP
SET ( \fIstorage_parameter\fR [= \fIvalue\fR] [, \&.\&.\&. ] )
.RS 4
This form changes one or more storage parameters for the table\&. See
Storage Parameters
for details on the available parameters\&. Note that the table contents will not be modified immediately by this command; depending on the parameter you might need to rewrite the table to get the desired effects\&. That can be done with
VACUUM FULL,
\fBCLUSTER\fR(7)
or one of the forms of
\fBALTER TABLE\fR
that forces a table rewrite\&. For planner related parameters, changes will take effect from the next time the table is locked so currently executing queries will not be affected\&.

.PP
INHERIT \fIparent_table\fR
.RS 4
This form adds the target table as a new child of the specified parent table\&. Subsequently, queries against the parent will include records of the target table\&. To be added as a child, the target table must already contain all the same columns as the parent (it could have additional columns, too)\&. The columns must have matching data types, and if they have
NOT NULL
constraints in the parent then they must also have
NOT NULL
constraints in the child\&.
.sp
There must also be matching child\-table constraints for all
CHECK
constraints of the parent, except those marked non\-inheritable (that is, created with
ALTER TABLE \&.\&.\&. ADD CONSTRAINT \&.\&.\&. NO INHERIT) in the parent, which are ignored; all child\-table constraints matched must not be marked non\-inheritable\&. Currently
UNIQUE,
PRIMARY KEY, and

constraints are not considered, but this might change in the future\&.
.RE

.RE
.PP
OF \fItype_name\fR
.RS 4
This form links the table to a composite type as though
\fBCREATE TABLE OF\fR
had formed it\&. The table\*(Aqs list of column names and types must precisely match that of the composite type; the presence of an
oid
system column is permitted to differ\&. The table must not inherit from any other table\&. These restrictions ensure that

REPLICA IDENTITY

.RE

SET SCHEMA
.RS 4
This form moves the table into another schema\&. Associated indexes, constraints, and sequences owned by table columns are moved as well\&.
.RE
.PP
ATTACH PARTITION \fIpartition_name\fR FOR VALUES \fIpartition_bound_spec\fR
.RS 4
This form attaches an existing table (which might itself be partitioned) as a partition of the target table using the same syntax for
\fIpartition_bound_spec\fR
as
CREATE TABLE (\fBCREATE_TABLE\fR(7))\&. The partition bound specification must correspond to the partitioning strategy and partition key of the target table\&. The table to be attached must have all the same columns as the target table and no more; moreover, the column types must also match\&. Also, it must have all the
NOT NULL
and
CHECK
constraints of the target table\&. Currently
UNIQUE,
PRIMARY KEY, and
FOREIGN KEY
constraints are not considered\&. If any of the
CHECK
constraints of the table being attached are marked
NO INHERIT, the command will fail; such constraints must be recreated without the
NO INHERIT
clause\&.
.sp
If the new partition is a regular table, a full table scan is performed to check that existing rows in the table do not violate the partition constraint\&. It is possible to avoid this scan by adding a valid
CHECK
constraint to the table that allows only rows satisfying the desired partition constraint before running this command\&. The
CHECK
constraint will be used to determine that the table need not be scanned to validate the partition constraint\&. This does not work, however, if any of the partition keys is an expression and the partition does not accept
NULL
values\&. If attaching a list partition that will not accept
NULL
values, also add
NOT NULL
constraint to the partition key column, unless it\*(Aqs an expression\&.
.sp
If the new partition is a foreign table, nothing is done to verify that all the rows in the foreign table obey the partition constraint\&. (See the discussion in
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE (\fBCREATE_FOREIGN_TABLE\fR(7))
about constraints on the foreign table\&.)
.RE
.PP
DETACH PARTITION \fIpartition_name\fR

.RE
.PP
All the forms of ALTER TABLE that act on a single table, except
RENAME,
SET SCHEMA,
ATTACH PARTITION, and
DETACH PARTITION
can be combined into a list of multiple alterations to be applied together\&. For example, it is possible to add several columns and/or alter the type of several columns in a single command\&. This is particularly useful with large tables, since only one pass over the table need be made\&.
.PP
You must own the table to use
\fBALTER TABLE\fR\&. To change the schema or tablespace of a table, you must also have
CREATE

.SH "NOTES"
.PP
The key word
COLUMN
is noise and can be omitted\&.
.PP
When a column is added with
ADD COLUMN, all existing rows in the table are initialized with the column\*(Aqs default value (NULL if no
DEFAULT
clause is specified)\&. If there is no
DEFAULT
clause, this is merely a metadata change and does not require any immediate update of the table\*(Aqs data; the added NULL values are supplied on readout, instead\&.
.PP
Adding a column with a
DEFAULT
clause or changing the type of an existing column will require the entire table and its indexes to be rewritten\&. As an exception when changing the type of an existing column, if the
USING
clause does not change the column contents and the old type is either binary coercible to the new type or an unconstrained domain over the new type, a table rewrite is not needed; but any indexes on the affected columns must still be rebuilt\&. Adding or removing a system
oid
column also requires rewriting the entire table\&. Table and/or index rebuilds may take a significant amount of time for a large table; and will temporarily require as much as double the disk space\&.
.PP
Adding a
CHECK
or
NOT NULL
constraint requires scanning the table to verify that existing rows meet the constraint, but does not require a table rewrite\&.
.PP
Similarly, when attaching a new partition it may be scanned to verify that existing rows meet the partition constraint\&.
.PP
The main reason for providing the option to specify multiple changes in a single
\fBALTER TABLE\fR
is that multiple table scans or rewrites can thereby be combined into a single pass over the table\&.
.PP
Scanning a large table to verify a new foreign key or check constraint can take a long time, and other updates to the table are locked out until the
\fBALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT\fR
command is committed\&. The main purpose of the
NOT VALID
constraint option is to reduce the impact of adding a constraint on concurrent updates\&. With
NOT VALID, the
\fBADD CONSTRAINT\fR
command does not scan the table and can be committed immediately\&. After that, a
VALIDATE CONSTRAINT
command can be issued to verify that existing rows satisfy the constraint\&. The validation step does not need to lock out concurrent updates, since it knows that other transactions will be enforcing the constraint for rows that they insert or update; only pre\-existing rows need to be checked\&. Hence, validation acquires only a
SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
lock on the table being altered\&. (If the constraint is a foreign key then a
ROW SHARE
lock is also required on the table referenced by the constraint\&.) In addition to improving concurrency, it can be useful to use
NOT VALID
and
VALIDATE CONSTRAINT
in cases where the table is known to contain pre\-existing violations\&. Once the constraint is in place, no new violations can be inserted, and the existing problems can be corrected at leisure until
VALIDATE CONSTRAINT
finally succeeds\&.
.PP
The
DROP COLUMN
form does not physically remove the column, but simply makes it invisible to SQL operations\&. Subsequent insert and update operations in the table will store a null value for the column\&. Thus, dropping a column is quick but it will not immediately reduce the on\-disk size of your table, as the space occupied by the dropped column is not reclaimed\&. The space will be reclaimed over time as existing rows are updated\&. (These statements do not apply when dropping the system
oid
column; that is done with an immediate rewrite\&.)
.PP
To force immediate reclamation of space occupied by a dropped column, you can execute one of the forms of
\fBALTER TABLE\fR
that performs a rewrite of the whole table\&. This results in reconstructing each row with the dropped column replaced by a null value\&.
.PP
The rewriting forms of
\fBALTER TABLE\fR
are not MVCC\-safe\&. After a table rewrite, the table will appear empty to concurrent transactions, if they are using a snapshot taken before the rewrite occurred\&. See
Section\ \&13.5
for more details\&.
.PP
The
USING
option of
SET DATA TYPE
can actually specify any expression involving the old values of the row; that is, it can refer to other columns as well as the one being converted\&. This allows very general conversions to be done with the
SET DATA TYPE
syntax\&. Because of this flexibility, the
USING
expression is not applied to the column\*(Aqs default value (if any); the result might not be a constant expression as required for a default\&. This means that when there is no implicit or assignment cast from old to new type,
SET DATA TYPE
might fail to convert the default even though a
USING
clause is supplied\&. In such cases, drop the default with
DROP DEFAULT, perform the
ALTER TYPE, and then use
SET DEFAULT
to add a suitable new default\&. Similar considerations apply to indexes and constraints involving the column\&.
.PP
If a table has any descendant tables, it is not permitted to add, rename, or change the type of a column in the parent table without doing same to the descendants\&. This ensures that the descendants always have columns matching the parent\&. Similarly, a constraint cannot be renamed in the parent without also renaming it in all descendants, so that constraints also match between the parent and its descendants\&. Also, because selecting from the parent also selects from its descendants, a constraint on the parent cannot be marked valid unless it is also marked valid for those descendants\&. In all of these cases,
\fBALTER TABLE ONLY\fR
will be rejected\&.
.PP
A recursive
DROP COLUMN
operation will remove a descendant table\*(Aqs column only if the descendant does not inherit that column from any other parents and never had an independent definition of the column\&. A nonrecursive
DROP COLUMN
(i\&.e\&.,
\fBALTER TABLE ONLY \&.\&.\&. DROP COLUMN\fR) never removes any descendant columns, but instead marks them as independently defined rather than inherited\&. A nonrecursive
DROP COLUMN
command will fail for a partitioned table, because all partitions of a table must have the same columns as the partitioning root\&.
.PP
The actions for identity columns (ADD GENERATED,
SET
etc\&.,
DROP IDENTITY), as well as the actions
TRIGGER,
CLUSTER,
OWNER, and
TABLESPACE
never recurse to descendant tables; that is, they always act as though
ONLY
were specified\&. Adding a constraint recurses only for
CHECK
constraints that are not marked
NO INHERIT\&.

Changing any part of a system catalog table is not permitted\&.
