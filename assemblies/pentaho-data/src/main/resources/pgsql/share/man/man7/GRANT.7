.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBGRANT\fR
command has two basic variants: one that grants privileges on a database object (table, column, view, foreign table, sequence, database, foreign\-data wrapper, foreign server, function, procedural language, schema, or tablespace), and one that grants membership in a role\&. These variants are similar in many ways, but they are different enough to be described separately\&.
.SS "GRANT on Database Objects"
.PP
This variant of the
\fBGRANT\fR
command gives specific privileges on a database object to one or more roles\&. These privileges are added to those already granted, if any\&.
.PP
There is also an option to grant privileges on all objects of the same type within one or more schemas\&. This functionality is currently supported only for tables, sequences, and functions (but note that
ALL TABLES
is considered to include views and foreign tables)\&.
.PP
The key word
PUBLIC
indicates that the privileges are to be granted to all roles, including those that might be created later\&.
PUBLIC
can be thought of as an implicitly defined group that always includes all roles\&. Any particular role will have the sum of privileges granted directly to it, privileges granted to any role it is presently a member of, and privileges granted to
PUBLIC\&.
.PP
If
WITH GRANT OPTION
is specified, the recipient of the privilege can in turn grant it to others\&. Without a grant option, the recipient cannot do that\&. Grant options cannot be granted to
PUBLIC\&.
.PP
There is no need to grant privileges to the owner of an object (usually the user that created it), as the owner has all privileges by default\&. (The owner could, however, choose to revoke some of their own privileges for safety\&.)
.PP
The right to drop an object, or to alter its definition in any way, is not treated as a grantable privilege; it is inherent in the owner, and cannot be granted or revoked\&. (However, a similar effect can be obtained by granting or revoking membership in the role that owns the object; see below\&.) The owner implicitly has all grant options for the object, too\&.
.PP
PostgreSQL grants default privileges on some types of objects to
PUBLIC\&. No privileges are granted to
PUBLIC
by default on tables, table columns, sequences, foreign data wrappers, foreign servers, large objects, schemas, or tablespaces\&. For other types of objects, the default privileges granted to
PUBLIC
are as follows:
CONNECT
and
TEMPORARY
(create temporary tables) privileges for databases;
EXECUTE
privilege for functions; and
USAGE
privilege for languages and data types (including domains)\&. The object owner can, of course,
\fBREVOKE\fR
both default and expressly granted privileges\&. (For maximum security, issue the
\fBREVOKE\fR
in the same transaction that creates the object; then there is no window in which another user can use the object\&.) Also, these initial default privilege settings can be changed using the
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES (\fBALTER_DEFAULT_PRIVILEGES\fR(7))
command\&.
.PP
The possible privileges are:
.PP
SELECT
.RS 4
Allows
\fBSELECT\fR(7)
from any column, or the specific columns listed, of the specified table, view, or sequence\&. Also allows the use of
\fBCOPY\fR(7)
TO\&. This privilege is also needed to reference existing column values in
\fBUPDATE\fR(7)
or
\fBDELETE\fR(7)\&. For sequences, this privilege also allows the use of the
\fBcurrval\fR
function\&. For large objects, this privilege allows the object to be read\&.
.RE
.PP
INSERT
.RS 4
Allows
\fBINSERT\fR(7)
of a new row into the specified table\&. If specific columns are listed, only those columns may be assigned to in the
\fBINSERT\fR
command (other columns will therefore receive default values)\&. Also allows
\fBCOPY\fR(7)
FROM\&.
.RE
.PP
UPDATE
.RS 4
Allows
\fBUPDATE\fR(7)
of any column, or the specific columns listed, of the specified table\&. (In practice, any nontrivial
\fBUPDATE\fR
command will require
SELECT
privilege as well, since it must reference table columns to determine which rows to update, and/or to compute new values for columns\&.)
SELECT \&.\&.\&. FOR UPDATE
and
SELECT \&.\&.\&. FOR SHARE
also require this privilege on at least one column, in addition to the
SELECT
privilege\&. For sequences, this privilege allows the use of the
\fBnextval\fR
and
\fBsetval\fR
functions\&. For large objects, this privilege allows writing or truncating the object\&.
.RE
.PP
DELETE
.RS 4
Allows
\fBDELETE\fR(7)
of a row from the specified table\&. (In practice, any nontrivial
\fBDELETE\fR
command will require
SELECT
privilege as well, since it must reference table columns to determine which rows to delete\&.)
.RE
.PP
TRUNCATE
.RS 4
Allows
\fBTRUNCATE\fR(7)
on the specified table\&.
.RE
.PP
REFERENCES
.RS 4
Allows creation of a foreign key constraint referencing the specified table, or specified column(s) of the table\&. (See the
CREATE TABLE (\fBCREATE_TABLE\fR(7))
statement\&.)
.RE
.PP
TRIGGER
.RS 4
Allows the creation of a trigger on the specified table\&. (See the
CREATE TRIGGER (\fBCREATE_TRIGGER\fR(7))
statement\&.)
.RE
.PP
CREATE
.RS 4
For databases, allows new schemas and publications to be created within the database\&.
.sp
For schemas, allows new objects to be created within the schema\&. To rename an existing object, you must own the object
\fIand\fR
have this privilege for the containing schema\&.
.sp
For tablespaces, allows tables, indexes, and temporary files to be created within the tablespace, and allows databases to be created that have the tablespace as their default tablespace\&. (Note that revoking this privilege will not alter the placement of existing objects\&.)
.RE
.PP
CONNECT
.RS 4
Allows the user to connect to the specified database\&. This privilege is checked at connection startup (in addition to checking any restrictions imposed by
pg_hba\&.conf)\&.
.RE
.PP
TEMPORARY
.br
TEMP
.RS 4
Allows temporary tables to be created while using the specified database\&.
.RE
.PP
EXECUTE
.RS 4
Allows the use of the specified function and the use of any operators that are implemented on top of the function\&. This is the only type of privilege that is applicable to functions\&. (This syntax works for aggregate functions, as well\&.)
.RE
.PP
USAGE
.RS 4
For procedural languages, allows the use of the specified language for the creation of functions in that language\&. This is the only type of privilege that is applicable to procedural languages\&.
.sp
For schemas, allows access to objects contained in the specified schema (assuming that the objects\*(Aq own privilege requirements are also met)\&. Essentially this allows the grantee to
\(lqlook up\(rq
objects within the schema\&. Without this permission, it is still possible to see the object names, e\&.g\&., by querying the system tables\&. Also, after revoking this permission, existing backends might have statements that have previously performed this lookup, so this is not a completely secure way to prevent object access\&.
.sp
For sequences, this privilege allows the use of the
\fBcurrval\fR
and
\fBnextval\fR
functions\&.
.sp
For types and domains, this privilege allows the use of the type or domain in the creation of tables, functions, and other schema objects\&. (Note that it does not control general
\(lqusage\(rq
of the type, such as values of the type appearing in queries\&. It only prevents objects from being created that depend on the type\&. The main purpose of the privilege is controlling which users create dependencies on a type, which could prevent the owner from changing the type later\&.)
.sp
For foreign\-data wrappers, this privilege allows creation of new servers using the foreign\-data wrapper\&.
.sp
For servers, this privilege allows creation of foreign tables using the server\&. Grantees may also create, alter, or drop their own user mappings associated with that server\&.
.RE
.PP
ALL PRIVILEGES
.RS 4
Grant all of the available privileges at once\&. The
PRIVILEGES
key word is optional in
PostgreSQL, though it is required by strict SQL\&.
.RE
The privileges required by other commands are listed on the reference page of the respective command\&.
.SS "GRANT on Roles"
.PP
This variant of the
\fBGRANT\fR
command grants membership in a role to one or more other roles\&. Membership in a role is significant because it conveys the privileges granted to a role to each of its members\&.
.PP
If
WITH ADMIN OPTION
is specified, the member can in turn grant membership in the role to others, and revoke membership in the role as well\&. Without the admin option, ordinary users cannot do that\&. A role is not considered to hold
WITH ADMIN OPTION
on itself, but it may grant or revoke membership in itself from a database session where the session user matches the role\&. Database superusers can grant or revoke membership in any role to anyone\&. Roles having
CREATEROLE
privilege can grant or revoke membership in any role that is not a superuser\&.
.PP
If
GRANTED BY
is specified, the grant is recorded as having been done by the specified role\&. Only database superusers may use this option, except when it names the same role executing the command\&.
.PP
Unlike the case with privileges, membership in a role cannot be granted to
PUBLIC\&. Note also that this form of the command does not allow the noise word
GROUP
in
\fIrole_specification\fR\&.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
The
\fBREVOKE\fR(7)
command is used to revoke access privileges\&.
.PP
Since
PostgreSQL
8\&.1, the concepts of users and groups have been unified into a single kind of entity called a role\&. It is therefore no longer necessary to use the keyword
GROUP
to identify whether a grantee is a user or a group\&.
GROUP
is still allowed in the command, but it is a noise word\&.
.PP
A user may perform
\fBSELECT\fR,
\fBINSERT\fR, etc\&. on a column if they hold that privilege for either the specific column or its whole table\&. Granting the privilege at the table level and then revoking it for one column will not do what one might wish: the table\-level grant is unaffected by a column\-level operation\&.
.PP
When a non\-owner of an object attempts to
\fBGRANT\fR
privileges on the object, the command will fail outright if the user has no privileges whatsoever on the object\&. As long as some privilege is available, the command will proceed, but it will grant only those privileges for which the user has grant options\&. The
\fBGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES\fR
forms will issue a warning message if no grant options are held, while the other forms will issue a warning if grant options for any of the privileges specifically named in the command are not held\&. (In principle these statements apply to the object owner as well, but since the owner is always treated as holding all grant options, the cases can never occur\&.)
.PP
It should be noted that database superusers can access all objects regardless of object privilege settings\&. This is comparable to the rights of
root
in a Unix system\&. As with
root, it\*(Aqs unwise to operate as a superuser except when absolutely necessary\&.
.PP
If a superuser chooses to issue a
\fBGRANT\fR
or
\fBREVOKE\fR
command, the command is performed as though it were issued by the owner of the affected object\&. In particular, privileges granted via such a command will appear to have been granted by the object owner\&. (For role membership, the membership appears to have been granted by the containing role itself\&.)
.PP
\fBGRANT\fR
and
\fBREVOKE\fR
can also be done by a role that is not the owner of the affected object, but is a member of the role that owns the object, or is a member of a role that holds privileges
WITH GRANT OPTION
on the object\&. In this case the privileges will be recorded as having been granted by the role that actually owns the object or holds the privileges
WITH GRANT OPTION\&. For example, if table
t1
is owned by role
g1, of which role
u1
is a member, then
u1
can grant privileges on
t1
to
u2, but those privileges will appear to have been granted directly by
g1\&. Any other member of role
g1
could revoke them later\&.
.PP
If the role executing
\fBGRANT\fR
holds the required privileges indirectly via more than one role membership path, it is unspecified which containing role will be recorded as having done the grant\&. In such cases it is best practice to use
\fBSET ROLE\fR
to become the specific role you want to do the
\fBGRANT\fR
as\&.
.PP
Granting permission on a table does not automatically extend permissions to any sequences used by the table, including sequences tied to
SERIAL
columns\&. Permissions on sequences must be set separately\&.
.PP
Use
\fBpsql\fR(1)\*(Aqs
\fB\edp\fR
command to obtain information about existing privileges for tables and columns\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
=> \edp mytable
                              Access privileges
 Schema |  Name   | Type  |   Access privileges   | Column access privileges 
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
 public | mytable | table | miriam=arwdDxt/miriam | col1:
                          : =r/miriam             :   miriam_rw=rw/miriam
                          : admin=arw/miriam        
(1 row)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The entries shown by
\fB\edp\fR
are interpreted thus:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}

        =xxxx \-\- privileges granted to PUBLIC

            a \-\- INSERT ("append")

            * \-\- grant option for preceding privilege

        /yyyy \-\- role that granted this privilege
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The above example display would be seen by user
miriam
after creating table
mytable
and doing:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
GRANT SELECT ON mytable TO PUBLIC;
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT ON mytable TO admin;
GRANT SELECT (col1), UPDATE (col1) ON mytable TO miriam_rw;
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
For non\-table objects there are other
\fB\ed\fR
commands that can display their privileges\&.
.PP
If the
\(lqAccess privileges\(rq
column is empty for a given object, it means the object has default privileges (that is, its privileges column is null)\&. Default privileges always include all privileges for the owner, and can include some privileges for
PUBLIC
depending on the object type, as explained above\&. The first
\fBGRANT\fR
or
\fBREVOKE\fR
on an object will instantiate the default privileges (producing, for example,
{miriam=arwdDxt/miriam}) and then modify them per the specified request\&. Similarly, entries are shown in
\(lqColumn access privileges\(rq
only for columns with nondefault privileges\&. (Note: for this purpose,
\(lqdefault privileges\(rq
always means the built\-in default privileges for the object\*(Aqs type\&. An object whose privileges have been affected by an
\fBALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES\fR
command will always be shown with an explicit privilege entry that includes the effects of the
\fBALTER\fR\&.)
.PP
Notice that the owner\*(Aqs implicit grant options are not marked in the access privileges display\&. A
*
will appear only when grant options have been explicitly granted to someone\&.

.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
According to the SQL standard, the
PRIVILEGES
key word in
ALL PRIVILEGES
is required\&. The SQL standard does not support setting the privileges on more than one object per command\&.
.PP
PostgreSQL
allows an object owner to revoke their own ordinary privileges: for example, a table owner can make the table read\-only to themselves by revoking their own
INSERT,
UPDATE,
DELETE, and
TRUNCATE
privileges\&. This is not possible according to the SQL standard\&. The reason is that
PostgreSQL
treats the owner\*(Aqs privileges as having been granted by the owner to themselves; therefore they can revoke them too\&. In the SQL standard, the owner\*(Aqs privileges are granted by an assumed entity
\(lq_SYSTEM\(rq\&. Not being
\(lq_SYSTEM\(rq, the owner cannot revoke these rights\&.
.PP
According to the SQL standard, grant options can be granted to
PUBLIC; PostgreSQL only supports granting grant options to roles\&.
.PP
The SQL standard allows the
GRANTED BY
option to be used in all forms of
\fBGRANT\fR\&. PostgreSQL only supports it when granting role membership, and even then only superusers may use it in nontrivial ways\&.
.PP
The SQL standard provides for a
USAGE
privilege on other kinds of objects: character sets, collations, translations\&.
.PP
In the SQL standard, sequences only have a
USAGE
privilege, which controls the use of the
NEXT VALUE FOR
expression, which is equivalent to the function
\fBnextval\fR
in PostgreSQL\&. The sequence privileges
SELECT
and
UPDATE
are PostgreSQL extensions\&. The application of the sequence
USAGE
privilege to the
currval
function is also a PostgreSQL extension (as is the function itself)\&.
.PP
Privileges on databases, tablespaces, schemas, and languages are
PostgreSQL
extensions\&.
