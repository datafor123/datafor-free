.SH "NAME"
pg_dump \- extract a PostgreSQL database into a script file or other archive file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBpg_dump\fR\ 'u
\fBpg_dump\fR [\fIconnection\-option\fR...] [\fIoption\fR...] [\fIdbname\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
pg_dump
is a utility for backing up a
PostgreSQL
database\&. It makes consistent backups even if the database is being used concurrently\&.
pg_dump
does not block other users accessing the database (readers or writers)\&.
.PP
pg_dump
only dumps a single database\&. To backup global objects that are common to all databases in a cluster, such as roles and tablespaces, use
\fBpg_dumpall\fR(1)\&.
.PP
Dumps can be output in script or archive file formats\&. Script dumps are plain\-text files containing the SQL commands required to reconstruct the database to the state it was in at the time it was saved\&. To restore from such a script, feed it to
\fBpsql\fR(1)\&. Script files can be used to reconstruct the database even on other machines and other architectures; with some modifications, even on other SQL database products\&.
.PP
The alternative archive file formats must be used with
\fBpg_restore\fR(1)
to rebuild the database\&. They allow
pg_restore
to be selective about what is restored, or even to reorder the items prior to being restored\&. The archive file formats are designed to be portable across architectures\&.
.PP
When used with one of the archive file formats and combined with
pg_restore,
pg_dump
provides a flexible archival and transfer mechanism\&.
pg_dump
can be used to backup an entire database, then
pg_restore
can be used to examine the archive and/or select which parts of the database are to be restored\&. The most flexible output file formats are the
\(lqcustom\(rq
format (\fB\-Fc\fR) and the
\(lqdirectory\(rq
format (\fB\-Fd\fR)\&. They allow for selection and reordering of all archived items, support parallel restoration, and are compressed by default\&. The
\(lqdirectory\(rq
format is the only format that supports parallel dumps\&.
.PP
While running
pg_dump, one should examine the output for any warnings (printed on standard error), especially in light of the limitations listed below\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following command\-line options control the content and format of the output\&.
.PP
\fIdbname\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the name of the database to be dumped\&. If this is not specified, the environment variable
\fBPGDATABASE\fR
is used\&. If that is not set, the user name specified for the connection is used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-a\fR
.br
\fB\-\-data\-only\fR
.RS 4
Dump only the data, not the schema (data definitions)\&. Table data, large objects, and sequence values are dumped\&.
.sp
This option is similar to, but for historical reasons not identical to, specifying
\fB\-\-section=data\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-b\fR
.br
\fB\-\-blobs\fR
.RS 4
Include large objects in the dump\&. This is the default behavior except when
\fB\-\-schema\fR,
\fB\-\-table\fR, or
\fB\-\-schema\-only\fR
is specified\&. The
\fB\-b\fR
switch is therefore only useful to add large objects to dumps where a specific schema or table has been requested\&. Note that blobs are considered data and therefore will be included when \-\-data\-only is used, but not when \-\-schema\-only is\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-B\fR
.br
\fB\-\-no\-blobs\fR
.RS 4
Exclude large objects in the dump\&.
.sp
When both
\fB\-b\fR
and
\fB\-B\fR
are given, the behavior is to output large objects, when data is being dumped, see the
\fB\-b\fR
documentation\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-c\fR
.br
\fB\-\-clean\fR
.RS 4
Output commands to clean (drop) database objects prior to outputting the commands for creating them\&. (Unless
\fB\-\-if\-exists\fR
is also specified, restore might generate some harmless error messages, if any objects were not present in the destination database\&.)
.sp
This option is ignored when emitting an archive (non\-text) output file\&. For the archive formats, you can specify the option when you call
\fBpg_restore\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-C\fR
.br
\fB\-\-create\fR
.RS 4
Begin the output with a command to create the database itself and reconnect to the created database\&. (With a script of this form, it doesn\*(Aqt matter which database in the destination installation you connect to before running the script\&.) If
\fB\-\-clean\fR
is also specified, the script drops and recreates the target database before reconnecting to it\&.
.sp
This option is ignored when emitting an archive (non\-text) output file\&. For the archive formats, you can specify the option when you call
\fBpg_restore\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-E \fR\fB\fIencoding\fR\fR
.br
\fB\-\-encoding=\fR\fB\fIencoding\fR\fR
.RS 4
Create the dump in the specified character set encoding\&. By default, the dump is created in the database encoding\&. (Another way to get the same result is to set the
\fBPGCLIENTENCODING\fR
environment variable to the desired dump encoding\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f \fR\fB\fIfile\fR\fR
.br
\fB\-\-file=\fR\fB\fIfile\fR\fR
.RS 4
Send output to the specified file\&. This parameter can be omitted for file based output formats, in which case the standard output is used\&. It must be given for the directory output format however, where it specifies the target directory instead of a file\&. In this case the directory is created by
\fBpg_dump\fR
and must not exist before\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-F \fR\fB\fIformat\fR\fR
.br
\fB\-\-format=\fR\fB\fIformat\fR\fR
.RS 4
Selects the format of the output\&.
\fIformat\fR
can be one of the following:
.PP
p
.br
plain
.RS 4
Output a plain\-text
SQL
script file (the default)\&.
.RE
.PP
c
.br
custom
.RS 4
Output a custom\-format archive suitable for input into
pg_restore\&. Together with the directory output format, this is the most flexible output format in that it allows manual selection and reordering of archived items during restore\&. This format is also compressed by default\&.
.RE
.PP
d
.br
directory
.RS 4
Output a directory\-format archive suitable for input into
pg_restore\&. This will create a directory with one file for each table and blob being dumped, plus a so\-called Table of Contents file describing the dumped objects in a machine\-readable format that
pg_restore
can read\&. A directory format archive can be manipulated with standard Unix tools; for example, files in an uncompressed archive can be compressed with the
gzip
tool\&. This format is compressed by default and also supports parallel dumps\&.
.RE
.PP
t
.br
tar
.RS 4
Output a
\fBtar\fR\-format archive suitable for input into
pg_restore\&. The tar format is compatible with the directory format: extracting a tar\-format archive produces a valid directory\-format archive\&. However, the tar format does not support compression\&. Also, when using tar format the relative order of table data items cannot be changed during restore\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-j \fR\fB\fInjobs\fR\fR
.br
\fB\-\-jobs=\fR\fB\fInjobs\fR\fR
.RS 4
Run the dump in parallel by dumping
\fInjobs\fR
tables simultaneously\&. This option reduces the time of the dump but it also increases the load on the database server\&. You can only use this option with the directory output format because this is the only output format where multiple processes can write their data at the same time\&.
.sp
pg_dump
will open
\fInjobs\fR
+ 1 connections to the database, so make sure your
max_connections
setting is high enough to accommodate all connections\&.
.sp
Requesting exclusive locks on database objects while running a parallel dump could cause the dump to fail\&. The reason is that the
pg_dump
master process requests shared locks on the objects that the worker processes are going to dump later in order to make sure that nobody deletes them and makes them go away while the dump is running\&. If another client then requests an exclusive lock on a table, that lock will not be granted but will be queued waiting for the shared lock of the master process to be released\&. Consequently any other access to the table will not be granted either and will queue after the exclusive lock request\&. This includes the worker process trying to dump the table\&. Without any precautions this would be a classic deadlock situation\&. To detect this conflict, the
pg_dump
worker process requests another shared lock using the
NOWAIT
option\&. If the worker process is not granted this shared lock, somebody else must have requested an exclusive lock in the meantime and there is no way to continue with the dump, so
pg_dump
has no choice but to abort the dump\&.
.sp
For a consistent backup, the database server needs to support synchronized snapshots, a feature that was introduced in
PostgreSQL
9\&.2 for primary servers and 10 for standbys\&. With this feature, database clients can ensure they see the same data set even though they use different connections\&.
\fBpg_dump \-j\fR
uses multiple database connections; it connects to the database once with the master process and once again for each worker job\&. Without the synchronized snapshot feature, the different worker jobs wouldn\*(Aqt be guaranteed to see the same data in each connection, which could lead to an inconsistent backup\&.
.sp
If you want to run a parallel dump of a pre\-9\&.2 server, you need to make sure that the database content doesn\*(Aqt change from between the time the master connects to the database until the last worker job has connected to the database\&. The easiest way to do this is to halt any data modifying processes (DDL and DML) accessing the database before starting the backup\&. You also need to specify the
\fB\-\-no\-synchronized\-snapshots\fR
parameter when running
\fBpg_dump \-j\fR
against a pre\-9\&.2
PostgreSQL
server\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-n \fR\fB\fIschema\fR\fR
.br
\fB\-\-schema=\fR\fB\fIschema\fR\fR
.RS 4
Dump only schemas matching
\fIschema\fR; this selects both the schema itself, and all its contained objects\&. When this option is not specified, all non\-system schemas in the target database will be dumped\&. Multiple schemas can be selected by writing multiple
\fB\-n\fR
switches\&. Also, the
\fIschema\fR
parameter is interpreted as a pattern according to the same rules used by
psql\*(Aqs
\ed
commands (see
Patterns), so multiple schemas can also be selected by writing wildcard characters in the pattern\&. When using wildcards, be careful to quote the pattern if needed to prevent the shell from expanding the wildcards; see
EXAMPLES\&.

These statements will fail when the script is run unless it is started by a superuser (or the same user that owns all of the objects in the script)\&. To make a script that can be restored by any user, but will give that user ownership of all the objects, specify

This option is relevant only when creating a data\-only dump\&. It instructs
pg_dump

.sp
Presently, the commands emitted for
\fB\-\-disable\-triggers\fR
must be done as superuser\&. So, you should also specify a superuser name with
\fB\-S\fR, or preferably be careful to start the resulting script as a superuser\&.

This option is relevant only when dumping the contents of a table which has row security\&. By default,
pg_dump
will set
row_security
to off, to ensure that all data is dumped from the table\&. If the user does not have sufficient privileges to bypass row security, then an error is thrown\&. This parameter instructs
pg_dump
to set
row_security
to on instead, allowing the user to dump the parts of the contents of the table that they have access to\&.

This option is not beneficial for a dump which is intended only for disaster recovery\&. It could be useful for a dump used to load a copy of the database for reporting or other read\-only load sharing while the original database continues to be updated\&. Without it the dump may reflect a state which is not consistent with any serial execution of the transactions eventually committed\&. For example, if batch processing techniques are used, a batch may show as closed in the dump without all of the items which are in the batch appearing\&.
.sp
This option will make no difference if there are no read\-write transactions active when pg_dump is started\&. If read\-write transactions are active, the start of the dump may be delayed for an indeterminate length of time\&. Once running, performance with or without the switch is the same\&.

This option is useful when needing to synchronize the dump with a logical replication slot (see

pg_dump

This option has no effect on

This option is never essential, since
pg_dump

pg_dump

This utility, like most other

pg_dump
internally executes
\fBSELECT\fR
statements\&. If you have problems running
pg_dump, make sure you are able to select information from the database using, for example,
\fBpsql\fR(1)\&. Also, any default connection settings and environment variables used by the

front\-end library will apply\&.

The database activity of
pg_dump
is normally collected by the statistics collector\&. If this is undesirable, you can set parameter
\fItrack_counts\fR
to false via
\fBPGOPTIONS\fR
or the
ALTER USER
command\&.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
If your database cluster has any local additions to the
template1
database, be careful to restore the output of
pg_dump
into a truly empty database; otherwise you are likely to get errors due to duplicate definitions of the added objects\&. To make an empty database without any local additions, copy from
template0
not
template1, for example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
CREATE DATABASE foo WITH TEMPLATE template0;
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.PP
When a data\-only dump is chosen and the option
\fB\-\-disable\-triggers\fR
is used,
pg_dump
emits commands to disable triggers on user tables before inserting the data, and then commands to re\-enable them after the data has been inserted\&. If the restore is stopped in the middle, the system catalogs might be left in the wrong state\&.
.PP
The dump file produced by
pg_dump
does not contain the statistics used by the optimizer to make query planning decisions\&. Therefore, it is wise to run
\fBANALYZE\fR
after restoring from a dump file to ensure optimal performance; see
Section\ \&24.1.3
and
Section\ \&24.1.6
for more information\&. The dump file also does not contain any
\fBALTER DATABASE \&.\&.\&. SET\fR
commands; these settings are dumped by
\fBpg_dumpall\fR(1), along with database users and other installation\-wide settings\&.
.PP
Because
pg_dump
is used to transfer data to newer versions of
PostgreSQL, the output of
pg_dump
can be expected to load into
PostgreSQL
server versions newer than
pg_dump\*(Aqs version\&.
pg_dump
can also dump from
PostgreSQL
servers older than its own version\&. (Currently, servers back to version 8\&.0 are supported\&.) However,
pg_dump
cannot dump from
PostgreSQL
servers newer than its own major version; it will refuse to even try, rather than risk making an invalid dump\&. Also, it is not guaranteed that
pg_dump\*(Aqs output can be loaded into a server of an older major version \(em not even if the dump was taken from a server of that version\&. Loading a dump file into an older server may require manual editing of the dump file to remove syntax not understood by the older server\&. Use of the
\fB\-\-quote\-all\-identifiers\fR
option is recommended in cross\-version cases, as it can prevent problems arising from varying reserved\-word lists in different
PostgreSQL
versions\&.
.PP
When dumping logical replication subscriptions,
pg_dump
will generate
\fBCREATE SUBSCRIPTION\fR
commands that use the
connect = false
option, so that restoring the subscription does not make remote connections for creating a replication slot or for initial table copy\&. That way, the dump can be restored without requiring network access to the remote servers\&. It is then up to the user to reactivate the subscriptions in a suitable way\&. If the involved hosts have changed, the connection information might have to be changed\&. It might also be appropriate to truncate the target tables before initiating a new full table copy\&.
