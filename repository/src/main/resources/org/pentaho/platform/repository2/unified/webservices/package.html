  This package contains a variation of the IUnifiedRepository interface that has been modified to work within the
  restrictions imposed by various Java RPC technologies like JAX-WS and GWT. The restrictions are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Must supply no-arg constructors.</li>
  <li>No interfaces--only concrete types.</li>
  <li>No uses of the type Object or Serializable (possibly other types as well).</li>
  <li>No method overloading.</li>
  <li>No static inner classes.</li>
  <li>No InputStreams or other types that are not emulated by GWT.</li>
  <li>No arrays. (Technically they are allowed but use typed Lists instead.)
    https://jax-ws.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=813
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Java clients should never use the "safe" version of the IUnifiedRepository interface. Instead, clients should code to
  the IUnifiedRepository interface and use the adapter layer to convert the calls into calls on the web service client. In
  this way, the client code is location unaware--it can be calling code in the same JVM or a remote JVM.
