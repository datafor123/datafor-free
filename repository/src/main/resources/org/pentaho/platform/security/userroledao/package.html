Defines a data access object (DAO) for create, retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on users and roles. This
DAO is needed in two places: (1) the Pentaho Administration Console for changing users and roles and (2) the Pentaho BI Platform
for authentication.

One implementation of IUserRoleDao is based on Hibernate. It uses Spring's HibernateDaoSupport.

This package should not be confused with org.pentaho.platform.plugin.services.security.userrole which contains
implementations of IUserRoleListService. IUserRoleListService is primarily used for UIs that need to present
security-related information for reading only. Such a UI is the Permission interface in the legacy Pentaho BI Platform.
